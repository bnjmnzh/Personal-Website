            Student/ Learner Benjamin, 5'7: I'm always ahead 😤💯Staying on that grind 😈💪 Never fall behind ❌👊

            Hi, I'm Benjamin Zhuo. I am a third-year computer science student at the University of Toronto.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before that, I grew up in Richmond, British Colombia. I swam competitively with the Richmond Rapids for 10 years 
            I also volunteered at the LingYen Mountain Temple every weekend while I was in high school. If you want to go back even further, 
            I was born in Vancouver, which is not very far from Richmond. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up, I always had an interest in mathematics and computers. I enjoy watching Numberphile, 3blue1brown, and just about any random math video. 
            I also took IT classes in high school, which I found very fun. Thus, I was led to taking lots of math courses as well as my computer 
            science courses at UofT. I really enjoyed my intro to number theory class.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time I like to hit the gym and go for the occasional swim. I also play some video games. You can usually find me playing
            Teamfight Tactics or Osu! and sometimes League of Legends.
